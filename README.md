Unit Circle in Degrees, Minutes, Seconds


A rudimentary program to calculate the sin and cos values of all 1,296,000 seconds of the unit circle and print it to the console.

The program accomplishes this by using three nested loops for the degrees, minutes, and seconds. The math is performed for every second.

I tried to tell my Trigonometry professor that surveyors do not use radian measure for angles, but he was having none of it!
